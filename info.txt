# cookies are added having names  queryForum_name , queryForum_username , queryForum_useremail ,queryForum_userid

need to add following script in head of each html file except login and sign_up.


    <script>
        function redir() {
            if(!checkLoggedIn()) {
                window.location.href = "/queryForum_war/login.html";
            }
        }
    </script>

And change body tag as <body onLoad="redir();">

Also methods defined in js/cookie.js file to access logged in user details.

All cookies kept until logout or 30 min whichever is less;

Logout service is defined at webapi/user/logout which delete all cookies.
